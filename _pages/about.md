Hi! I’m **Ma. Adela Arenas**, a recent graduate with a **BSc in Applied Physics (major in Health Physics)**. My academic and internship experiences range from **neutron dosimetry and gamma spectrometry** to **statistical analysis and data visualization**. I’m passionate about **radiation protection, health physics, and medical applications of physics**, and I hope to contribute to the advancement of **science and technology in the Philippines** in the future.  

I recently moved to Canada to pursue opportunities in **medical physics and occupational health and safety**. Alongside my technical background, I also enjoy **teaching, mentoring, and facilitating seminars**, drawing from my experience in both research and community engagement.  

When I’m not working, you’ll find me enjoying **Kdramas, anime, and historical comedies**—or diving into a good book like Paulo Coelho's *The Alchemist*.
