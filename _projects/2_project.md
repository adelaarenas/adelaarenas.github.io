# Evaluation of Neutron Spectra in Different LINAC Configurations Using Bonner Spheres

## Overview
This project was my undergraduate thesis completed at the University of the Philippines Manila in collaboration with the **Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI)** and medical physicists from the **Philippine General Hospital (PGH)**.  
It focused on the **characterization of stray neutron radiation** generated by high-energy photon beams from a linear accelerator (LINAC), an important step in ensuring both **patient safety** and **radiation protection for medical staff**.  

## Objectives
- To measure neutron spectra produced under different LINAC configurations using a modified Bonner Sphere Spectrometer.  
- To unfold the neutron energy distribution using the **Frascati Unfolding Interactive Tool (FRUIT)**.  
- To assess neutron dose equivalents and identify potential risks to patients and staff.  

## Methodology
- **Experimental Setup:** Deployed a set of Bonner spheres coupled with a thermal neutron detector around a clinical LINAC treatment room.  
- **Data Acquisition:** Collected neutron count rates under varying LINAC energy and configuration settings.  
- **Spectral Unfolding:** Applied FRUIT software to reconstruct the neutron energy spectra.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Evaluated uncertainties in the unfolded results and compared them with reference spectra.

## Key Results
- Successfully obtained **neutron spectra** under different treatment conditions.  
- Identified that higher photon energies and certain LINAC settings lead to increased neutron contamination.  
- Demonstrated that unfolded spectra aligned with published reference data, validating the measurement and analysis approach.  
- Findings highlighted the importance of **optimizing LINAC use to minimize unintended neutron dose** for patients.  

## Skills Highlighted
- Experimental nuclear instrumentation (Bonner Sphere Spectrometer).  
- Radiation protection & health physics (LINAC shielding, neutron monitoring).  
- Data analysis with **spectral unfolding methods** (FRUIT).  
- Uncertainty quantification and statistical analysis.  
- Technical writing, scientific presentation, and collaboration with medical physicists.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
