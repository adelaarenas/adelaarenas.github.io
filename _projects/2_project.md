## Overview
This project was my undergraduate thesis completed at the University of the Philippines Manila in collaboration with the **Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI)** and medical physicists from the **Philippine General Hospital (PGH)**.  
It focused on the **characterization of stray neutron radiation** generated by high-energy photon beams from a linear accelerator (LINAC), an important step in ensuring both **patient safety** and **radiation protection for medical staff**.  

## Objectives
- To measure neutron spectra produced under different LINAC configurations using a modified Bonner Sphere Spectrometer.  
- To unfold the neutron energy distribution using the **Frascati Unfolding Interactive Tool (FRUIT)**.  
- To assess neutron dose equivalents and identify potential risks to patients and staff.  

## Methodology
- **Experimental Setup:** Deployed a set of Bonner spheres coupled with a thermal neutron detector around a clinical LINAC treatment room.  
- **Data Acquisition:** Collected neutron count rates under varying LINAC energy and configuration settings.  
- **Spectral Unfolding:** Applied FRUIT software to reconstruct the neutron energy spectra.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Evaluated uncertainties in the unfolded results and compared them with reference spectra.

## Key Results
- Successfully obtained **neutron spectra** under different treatment conditions.  
- Identified that higher photon energies and certain LINAC settings lead to increased neutron contamination.  
- Demonstrated that unfolded spectra aligned with published reference data, validating the measurement and analysis approach.  
- Findings highlighted the importance of **optimizing LINAC use to minimize unintended neutron dose** for patients.  

## Skills Highlighted
- Experimental nuclear instrumentation (Bonner Sphere Spectrometer).  
- Radiation protection & health physics (LINAC shielding, neutron monitoring).  
- Data analysis with **spectral unfolding methods** (FRUIT).  
- Uncertainty quantification and statistical analysis.  
- Technical writing, scientific presentation, and collaboration with medical physicists.
