## Overview
As part of my internship at the **Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI)**, I conducted the **energy calibration of a sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detector** using standard gamma-ray sources **Cobalt-60 (Co-60)** and **Cesium-137 (Cs-137)**.

## Objectives  
- To perform the **energy and efficiency calibration** of a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector.  
- To analyze the resulting spectra of Cs-137 (~662 keV) and Co-60 (~1173, ~1332 keV) gamma peaks.  
- To apply **linear regression** in determining the calibration curve (channel vs. energy).  
- To verify detector performance for use in further spectrometric analysis.

Methodology

---

Radiation detectors don’t “know” the exact energy of radiation they see — they only produce signals as electrical pulses. To interpret these signals, we need to **calibrate** the detector. This is like teaching a thermometer what "0°C" and "100°C" mean using ice and boiling water.  

Each radioactive source emits photons at very specific energies (Cs-137 at ~662 keV, Co-60 at ~1173 and ~1332 keV). The detector outputs these as “channels” on a spectrum — basically counts vs. signal size.

By plotting known energies vs. observed channel numbers, I performed a **linear regression** to find the line of best fit.

\[
E = m \cdot \text{Channel} + b
\]

where *m* is the slope and *b* the intercept.

- **R-value:** Close to 1.0, showing strong correlation.  
- **Uncertainties:** Included both statistical (counting fluctuations) and instrumental uncertainties.
